                GreensBeans opened business in 2015 with a goal of providing our community with high quality, locally roasted coffee!
                We know that everything in the world is expensive as it is, wich is why we strive to keep our prices affordable while still paying our employees a living wage.
                All of our coffee beans come from locally sourced farms that practice sustainable growing methods. Stop by anytime to try a cup and see why we say "Beans make the Greens!"
